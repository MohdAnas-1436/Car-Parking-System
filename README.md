# 🚗 Car-Parking-System

> **A real-time distance detection system that mimics a car's reverse parking sensor using ultrasonic waves.**

---

## 📖 Overview

This project utilizes an **Arduino Uno** and an **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** to detect the proximity of an object. As an object moves closer to the sensor, the system provides audio-visual feedback using an **LED** and a **Buzzer**.

It demonstrates fundamental concepts of **Embedded Systems**, including sensor interfacing, digital I/O control, and physics-based calculations in C++.

---

## ✨ Features

* **Real-time Distance Calculation:** Accurate measurement in centimeters using sonar.
* **Dual Alert System:** Visual (LED) and Audio (Buzzer) warnings.
* **Threshold Logic:** automatically triggers alarms when an object is within **10 cm**.
* **Serial Monitoring:** Live distance data output to the Serial Monitor for debugging.
